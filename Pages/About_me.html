                Hey, My name is Derrick.
                </h2>
                <P>
                    Here is my first web page. Fantasising to be a 
                    programmer, I tried several times to learn coding 
                    without success. My first experience of coding is 
                    from a university introduction computing course. 
                    The course generally introduced what computing is 
                    and studied some basic JavaScript coding. Providing 
                    different JavaScript templates for students to amend. 
                    It didn’t arouse my interest in coding as the course 
                    was far away from the real situation. Media influence 
                    and successful person biography such as Elon Musk or 
                    Steve Jobs, coding gives me a sense of professionalism 
                    and chill. 
                </P>
                <p>
                    To put words into action, I bought my first book about 
                    android development. I remember the book taught me to 
                    use Eclipse to build a mobile application. Following 
                    step by step, I was stuck in the beginning chapter. 
                    It didn’t work at all. This experience implanted a thought 
                    that computing is difficult to an amateur who is completely 
                    new to the field. Without fully giving up coding, I was 
                    occasionally motivated and started from a different angle. 
                    What I have tried included Sams Teach Yourself C Programming 
                    in One Hour a Day; Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, or 
                    youtube Harvard CS50 course, lego mindstorm. Each time I start 
                    from scratch, one byte to 8 bits, for loop etc and end with 
                    various excuses. Finally, I met Odin Project to write the web. 
                    The web is constituted from copy, experiment and error.
